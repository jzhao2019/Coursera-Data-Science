Things to think about for week 4 Assignments

Part 1:
    1. Do all columns of the data needs to be read in as character?
    2. Hist() function only works with numeric vector.
  
 Part 2:
    1. The value "Not Available" in the data fields are not same as NA's. They are a character string. It needs to be considered when comparing values or sort them.
    
 
 Part 3:
 
 Part 4: 
    1. the default mode of a column in data frame is "factor". when creating a data frame, the argument for "stringsAsFactors" needs to be set to FALSE if you want it to be character().
